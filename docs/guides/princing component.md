# VI. High Level Concept

## 1. Document Overview:

About: The purpose of this document is to describe the Utina Platform approach regarding handling pricing concepts. It also serves as a guide to help manage the different features and proceed to the configuration using detailed setting books and screens.

Utina Pricing is a powerful tool,
easy to set up and maintain

## 2. Pricing Overview:

The pricing is the value establishment of all criteria allowing a predefined model for payment calculation.

In general, when a user leases an asset, the user&#39;s monthly payment will be calculated based on the several factors:

- How much the user has to pay at the start of the lease, which is the upfront;
- The lease&#39;s term or duration in Months or Years;
- The expected asset value at the end of the lease;
- The fees that he will have to pay at the end of the lease, which is the Residual Value;
- The &quot;money factor&quot; or rent charge, which is similar to an interest rate on an asset loan;
- Possible termination fees if the user wants to return the asset before the lease ends;
- Etc.â€¦

Once we define the asset amount, down payment, residual value, duration, and interest rate in the pricing, we will get the payment price.

In Utina Platform, we define the pricing as the lease/rental agreement covering different concepts that will be described in this document:

- Offer
- Pricing Element
- Pricing Filtering
- Pricing Pack
- Commission
- Service
- Marketing Campaign

## 3. MCD Conceptual Data Model:

From simple to highly complex,

Utina handles any Pricing Model!

![](../../assets/13.jpg)

**The Type of Rate:**

- **Nominal rate** is a rate of interest used in adding compound interest to a principal sum when interest is compounded other than annually.
- **Effective rate** is an [actual](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/actual) [rate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/rate) after everything has been [considered](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/considered), [rather](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/rather) than a [rate](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/rate) that is [planned](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/planned), [offered](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/offer), etc.
- **Discounted at the end of the period**.
- **Discounted at begin of the period**.
